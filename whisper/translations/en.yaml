      Number of candidates to consider simultaneously during transcription.
      Increasing the beam size will increase accuracy at the cost of
      performance.

    name: Language
    description: >-
      Language that you will speak to the add-on. If you select "auto",
      the model will run much slower but will auto-detect the spoken language.
  model:
    name: Model
    description: |
      Whisper model that will be used for transcription.

      The default model is `tiny-int8`, a compressed version of the smallest
      Whisper model which is able to run on a Raspberry Pi 4. Compressed models
      (`int8`) are slightly less accurate than their counterparts, but smaller
      and faster.

      This will define a prompt passed to whisper before parsing your voice.
      Including things that may appear in your commands, like uncommon names,
      may help their recognition.
